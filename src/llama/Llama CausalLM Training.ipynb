Well, I got news for you, jerk: This store would survive without you. Without me either. All you do is overcompensate for having what's basically a monkey's job: You push fucking buttons. Any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs, but you're obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important, so much more epic than it really is. You work in a convenience store, Dante. And badly, I might add. And I work in a shitty video store.  Badly, as well.  You know, that guy Jay's got it right- he has no delusions about what he does. Us?  We like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here, just looking to pick up a paper or-God forbid- cigarettes. We look down on them, as it we're so advanced.  Well, if we're so fucking advanced, then what are we doing working here?\n",

      "randal: You didn't have to choke me.\n",

      "randal: I thought I was doing you a favor.\n",
      "dante: Thanks.\n",

      "dante: I should shit or get off the pot.\n",
      "randal: Yeah, you should shit or get off the pot.\n",
      "dante: What are you talking about?\n",
      "randal: I'm talking about this thing you have... this inability to improve your situation in life.\n",
      "dante: Fuck you.\n",
      "randal: It's true. You'll sit there and blame life for dealing a cruddy hand, never once accepting the responsibility for the way your situation is.\n",
      "dante: What responsibility?\n",
      "randal: All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.\n",
      "dante: As if it's that easy.\n",
      "randal: It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?\n",
      "dante: Leave me alone.\n",
      "randal: You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.\n",
      "dante: Oh, like your life's any better?\n",
      "randal: I'm satisfied with my situation for now. You don't hear me bitching. You, on the other hand, have been bitching all day.\n",
      "dante: Thank you. Why don't you go back to the video store?\n",
      "randal: It's the same thing with Veronica.\n",
      "dante: Leave her out of this.\n",
      "randal: You date Veronica because she's low maintenance and because it's convenient. Meanwhile, all you ever do is talk about Caitlin. You carry a torch for a girl you dated in high school-in high school for God's sake! You're twenty-two!\n",
      "dante: Leave me alone.\n",
      "randal: If you want Caitlin, then face Veronica, tell her, and be with Caitlin. If you want Veronica, be with Veronica. But don't pine for one and fuck the other. Man, if you weren't such a fucking coward...\n",
      "dante:...If I wasn't such a fucking coward.  It must be so great to be able to simplify everything the way you do.\n",

      "dante: You're wrong. Things happened today, okay? Things that probably ruined my chances with Caitlin.\n",
      "randal: What? The dead guy?  She'll get over fucking the dead guy. Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy for thirty years; I call him Dad.\n",
      "dante: Caitlin and I can't be together. It's impossible.\n",
      "randal: Melodrama coming from you seems about as natural as an oral bowel movement.\n",
      "dante: What do you want me to say? Yes, I suppose some of the things you're saying may be true. But that's the way things are; it's not going to change.\n",
      "randal: Make them change.\n",
      "dante: I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.\n",
      "randal: Who're you kidding? You can so.\n",
      "dante: Jesus H. Christ, I can't!\n",
      "randal: So you'll continue being miserable all the time, just because you don't have the guts to face change?\n",
      "dante: My mother told me once that when I as three, my potty lid was closed, and instead of lifting it, I chose to shit my pants.\n",
      "randal: Lovely story.\n",

      "randal: And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.\n",
      "dante: What?\n",
      "randal: If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?\n",

      "randal: If you must.\n",

      "randal: I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.\n",
      "dante: There's a difference. Those were obligations. Obligations that could not have been met at any later date. Now renting videos-that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store.\n",

      "dante: What kind of show?\n",
      "randal: Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.\n",
      "dante: Can we talk about this later?\n",
      "randal: The jizz-mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and I don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away.\n",

      "dante: There's more?\n",
      "randal: So they build another Death Star, right?\n",
      "dante: Yeah.\n",
      "randal: Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.\n",
      "dante: Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.\n",
      "randal: And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.\n",
      "dante: Compliments of Lando Calrissian.\n",
      "randal: Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.\n",
      "dante: And you figured it out?\n",
      "randal: Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.\n",
      "dante: Basically.\n",
      "randal: So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.\n",
      "dante: And the second time around...?\n",
      "randal: The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.\n",
      "dante: So?\n",
      "randal: A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.\n",
      "dante: Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.\n",
      "randal: Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.\n",
      "dante: All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?\n",
      "randal: All those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed- casualties of a war they had nothing to do with.  All right, look-you're a roofer, and some juicy government contract comes your way; you got the wife and kids and the two-story in suburbia-this is a government contract, which means all sorts of benefits. All of a sudden these left-wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three-mile radius.  You didn't ask for that. You have no personal politics.

      "dante: It would stand to reason, yes.\n",
      "randal: Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.\n",

      "dante: Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.\n",
      "randal: Oh yeah.\n",
      "dante: I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.\n",
      "randal: You think things would be any different now?\n",
      "dante: They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.\n",

      "dante: This is my way of spitting water at life.\n",
      "randal: Hey, what about Veronica?\n",
      "dante: No! Don't bring it up. I don't want to think about that now. Let me enjoy this hour of bliss. I'll think about all of that later. In the meantime, nobody mentions the V word.\n",

      "randal: Two reasons: one, I hate when the people can't shut up about the stupid tabloid headlines.\n",
      "dante: Jesus!\n",
      "randal: And two, to make a point: title does not dictate behavior.\n",
      "dante: What?\n",
      "randal: If title dictated my behavior, as a clerk serving the public, I wouldn't be allowed to spit a mouthful of water at that guy. But I did, so my point is that people dictate their own behavior. Hence, even though I'm a clerk in this video store, I choose to go rent videos at Big Choice.  Agreed?\n",

      "randal: If you must.\n",
      "dante: We are employees of Quick Stop Convenience and RST video, respectively. As such, we have certain responsibilities which-though it may seem cruel and unusual-does include manning our posts until closing.\n",
      "randal: I see. So playing hockey and attending wakes-these practices are standard operating procedure.\n",
      "dante: There's a difference. Those were obligations. Obligations that could not have been met at any later date. Now renting videos-that's just gratuitous, not to mention illogical, considering you work in a video store.\n",

      "dante: Because I never tried to suck my own dick?\n",
      "randal: No, because you won't admit to it. As if a guy's a fucking pervert because he tries to go down on himself. You're as curious as the rest of us, pal. You've tried it.\n",

      "dante: Don't be an asshole. Somebody has to stay with the store.\n",

      "dante: FUCK!\n",

      "dante: I don't back down.\n",
      "randal: Yes, you do. You always back down. You assume blame that isn't yours, you come in when called as opposed to enjoying your day off, you buckle like a belt.\n",
      "dante: You know what pisses me off the most?\n",
      "randal: The fact that I'm right about your buckling?\n",
      "dante: I'm going to miss the game.\n",
      "randal: Because you buckled.\n",
      "dante: Would you shut the hell up with that shit? It's not helping.\n",

      "randal: Who cares? That lady's an asshole. Everybody that comes in here is way too uptight. This job would be great if it wasn't for the fucking customers.\n",
      "dante: I'm gonna hear it tomorrow.\n",
      "randal: You gotta loosen up, my friend. You'd feel a hell of a lot better if you'd rip into the occasional customer.\n",
      "dante: What for? They don't bother me if I don't bother them.\n",
      "randal: Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.\n",
      "dante: There aren't.\n",
      "randal: How can you lie like that? Why don't you vent? Vent your frustration. Come on, who pisses you off?\n",
      "dante: It's not really anyone per se, it's more of separate groupings.\n",
      "randal: Let's hear it.\n",
      "dante: The milkmaids.\n",
      "randal: The milkmaids?\n",
      "\n",
      "randal: Oh, it's great. You step into this little booth and there's this window between you and this naked woman, and she puts on this little show for like ten bucks.\n",
      "dante: What kind of show?\n",
      "randal: Think of the weirdest, craziest shit you'd like to see chicks do.  These chicks do it all. They insert things into any opening in their body... any opening.  He's led a very sheltered life.\n",
      "dante: Can we talk about this later?\n",
      "randal: The jizz-mopper's job is to clean up the booths afterward, because practically everybody shoots a load against the window, and I don't know if you know or not, but cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it right away.\n",
      "\n",
      "dante: Did you ever notice all the prices end in nine? Damn, that's eerie.\n",
      "randal: You know how much money the average jizz-mopper make per hour?\n",
      "dante: What's a jizz-mopper?\n",
      "randal: He's the guy in those nudie-booth joints who cleans up after each guy that jerks off.\n",
      "dante: Nudie booth?\n",
      "randal: Nudie booth. You've never been in a nudie booth?\n",
      "dante: I guess not.\n",
      "\n",
      "randal: What's he looking for?\n",
      "dante: He said he has to find a perfect dozen.\n",
      "randal: Perfect dozen.\n",
      "dante: Each egg has to be perfect.\n",
      "randal: The quest isn't going well?\n",
      "dante: Obviously not. Look at all the cartons that didn't make the grade.\n",
      "\n",
      "randal: You know what else I noticed in Jedi?\n",
      "dante: There's more?\n",
      "randal: So they build another Death Star, right?\n",
      "dante: Yeah.\n",
      "randal: Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.\n",
      "dante: Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.\n",
      "randal: And the second one was still being built when they blew it up.\n",
      "dante: Compliments of Lando Calrissian.\n",
      "randal: Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.\n",
      "dante: And you figured it out?\n",
      "randal: Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.\n",
      "dante: Basically.\n",
      "randal: So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.\n",
      "dante: And the second time around...?\n",
      "randal: The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.\n",
      "dante: So?\n",
      "randal: A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.\n",
      "dante: Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.\n",
      "randal: Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.\n",
      "dante: All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?\n",
      "randal: All those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed- casualties of a war they had nothing to do with.  All right, look-you're a roofer, and some juicy government contract comes your way; you got the wife and kids and the two-story in suburbia-this is a government contract, which means all sorts of benefits. All of a sudden these left-wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three-mile radius.  You didn't ask for that. You have no personal politics. You're just trying to scrape out a living.\n",
      "\n",
      "dante: What's that?\n",
      "randal: All right, Vader's boss...\n",
      "dante: The Emperor.\n",
      "randal: Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?\n",
      "dante: How do you mean?\n",
      "randal: Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.\n",
      "dante: I guess.\n",
      "randal: Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.\n",
      "dante: Yeah.\n",
      "randal: Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.\n",
      "dante: It would stand to reason, yes.\n",
      "randal: Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.\n",
      "dante: More or less.\n",
      "randal: The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.\n",
      "dante: I think they were Catholics.\n",
      "\n",
      "dante: Do you know that article is accurate? Caitlin's really getting married!\n",

      "randal: Which did you like better: Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back.\n",
      "dante: Empire.\n",
      "randal: Blasphemy.\n",
      "dante: Empire had the better ending: Luke gets his hand cut off, and finds out Vader's his father; Han gets frozen and taken away by Boba Fett.  It ends on such a down note. And that's life-a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.\n",
      "randal: There was something else going on in Jedi. I never noticed it until today.\n",
      "\n",
      "dante: You don't want to know.\n",

      "randal: What do you two fight about?\n",
      "dante: I guess it's not really fighting. She just wants me to leave here, go back to school, get some direction.\n",
      "randal: I'll bet the most frequent topic of arguments is Caitlin Bree.\n",
      "dante: You win.\n",
      "randal: I'm going to offer you some advice, my friend: let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin Bree. You've been with Veronica for how long now?\n",

      "dante: Five years.\n",

      "dante: Eight and a half.\n",
      "randal: Eight and a half?\n",
      "dante: Party at John K's-senior year. I get blitzed and pass out in his bedroom. Caitlin comes in and dives all over me.\n",
      "randal: That's cheating?\n",
      "dante: In the middle of it, she calls me Brad.\n",
      "randal: She called you Brad?\n",
      "dante: She called me Brad.\n",
      "randal: That's not cheating. People say crazy shit during sex. One time, I called this girl \"Mom.\"\n",
      "dante: I hit the lights and she freaks. Turns out she thought I was Brad Michaelson.\n",
      "randal: What do you mean?\n",
      "dante: She was supposed to meet Brad Michaelson in a bedroom. She picked the wrong one. She had no idea I was even at the party.\n",

      "dante: Great story, isn't it?\n",
      "randal: That girl was vile to you.\n",

      "randal: Your mother.\n",
      "dante: Allan Harris.\n",
      "randal: Chess team Allan Harris?!\n",
      "dante: The two moved to Idaho together after graduation. They raise sheep.\n",
      "randal: That's frightening.\n",
      "dante: It takes different strokes to move the world.\n",
      "randal: In light of this lurid tale, I don't see how you could even romanticize your relationship with Caitlin-she broke your heart and inadvertently drove men to deviant lifestyles.\n",
      "dante: Because there was a lot of good in our relationship.\n",
      "randal: Oh yeah.\n",
      "dante: I'm serious. Aside from the cheating, we were a great couple.  That's what high school's all about-algebra, bad lunch, and infidelity.\n",
      "randal: You think things would be any different now?\n",
      "dante: They are. When she calls me now, she's a different person-she's frightened and vulnerable. She's about to finish college and enter the real world. That's got to be scary for anyone.\n",
      "randal: Oh shit, I've got to place an order.\n",
      "dante: I'm talking to myself here.\n",
      "randal: No, no, I'm listening. She's leaving college, and...?\n",
      "dante:...and she's looking to me for support. And I think that this is leading our relationship to a new level.\n",
      "randal: What about Veronica?\n",
      "dante: I think the arguments Veronica and I are having are some kind of manifestation of a subconscious desire to break away from her so that I can pursue the possibility of a more meaningful relationship with Caitlin.\n",
      "randal: Caitlin's on the same wave-length?\n",
      "dante: I think it's safe to say yes.\n",

      "laura: Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.\n",

That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?

      "laura: I'm sorry to call, but I need that stuff...\n",

      "rob: No problem.  If I can ask one question.\n",

      "laura: You really think it would make a difference either way?\n",
      "rob: I don't know.\n",
      "laura: Well the answer is that I don't know either.  We haven't done it yet.\n",
      "rob: Never?\n",
      "laura: I haven't felt like it.\n",
      "rob: But not even before, when he was living upstairs?\n",
      "laura: No.  I was living with you, remember? We've slept together but we haven't made love.  Not yet.  But I'll tell you one thing.  The sleeping together is better.\n",
      "rob: The sleeping together is better but not the sex because you haven't done it was him yet.\n",
      "laura: Will you please just go?\n",
      "\n",
      "laura: Look.  Maybe you'll grow up and we'll get it together, you and me.  Maybe I'll never see either of you again. I don't know.  All I know is that it's not a good time to be living here.\n",
      "rob: So, what, you haven't definitely decide to dump me?  There's still a chance we'll get back together?\n",
      "laura: I don't know.\n",
      "rob: Well, if you don't know, there's a chance, right?  It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.\n",
      "laura: I suppose so.\n",
      "rob: So we have a chance of getting back together again.\n",

      "rob: No.  So.  Is it working out with Ian?\n",
      "laura: Rob.  Don't be childish.\n",
      "rob: Why is that childish?  Your living with the guy!  I'm just asking how it's going.\n",
      "laura: I am not living with him.  I've just been staying with him for a few days until I work out what I'm doing. Look, this has nothing to do with anyone else.  You know that, don't you?  I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.  But I have no idea what will happen with Ian in the long run.  Probably nothing.\n",

      "laura: What?  Gimme a fucking break.  Is that what you think?  That your not big enough a deal for me?  Jesus, gimme a little credit, Rob.\n",
      "rob: I don't know.  It's one of the things I thought of.\n",

      "ian: We've noticed and we're glad.  But, you know... how are we going to make peace here?  We want to make things easier for you.  What can we do? Obviously I know how special Laura is, and I know things can't be good for you at the moment.  I'd hate it if I lost her.  But I'd like to think that if she decided she didn't want to see me anymore, I'd respect that decision.  Do you see what I'm saying?\n",

      "rob: Fair enough.\n",
      "laura: So?\n",
      "rob: I'm just sick of thinking about it all the time.\n",
      "laura: About what?\n",
      "rob: This stuff.  Love and marriage.  I want to think about something else.\n",

      "rob: Shut up.  I'm only trying to explain.\n",
      "laura: I mean, maybe you're right.  But were you really expecting me to say yes?\n",
      "rob: I dunno.  Didn't think about it, really.  It was the asking that was the important thing.\n",

      "rob: Has Drag City Records, I know, I know.  You told Dan Koretzky about this?\n",
      "laura: Yeah, and he said it's a good way to break out a record.  Especially for what he said, and I quote, \"would be a highly anticipated event, locally.\" He helped me put out a press release.\n",
      "rob: WHAT?\n",
      "laura: Just local, of course.\n",
      "rob: And the \"triumphant return of DJ Rob Gordon?\" \"Triumphant?\" \"Return?\"\n",
      "laura: I had that idea when I was living with Ian and it was such a good idea that I was annoyed we weren't together anymore.  It might even be why I came back.\n",
      "rob: You had no right.  Supposing I was doing something that couldn't be cancelled?\n",
      "laura: What do you ever do that can't be cancelled?\n",
      "rob: That's not the point.  I mean, what if the single isn't done in time?\n",

      "rob: Where?\n",
      "laura: At Paul and Miranda's.  Paul from work.\n",
      "rob: Oh.  Well.  We don't really get along. Paul and I.\n",
      "laura: I know.  But you've never met.  It just seems like a stone unturned in your relationship with him.\n",
      "rob: Ha.\n",
      "\n",
      "laura:... Like Mexico.  Or Jamaica.  Or New York, even.\n",
      "rob: Hey, great idea.  What I'll do is, tomorrow I'll get a hold of a box full of mint Elvis Presley 78s on the Sub label, and I'll pay for it that way.\n",
      "laura: I'll pay for you.  Even though you owe me money.  We have to do something with the money I earn.  I need to. I deserve it.  You can just think of it as winning the lottery.\n",
      "rob: Fantastic.  The Girlfriend Lottery.\n",
      "laura: Money does not matter.  I do not care how much you earn.  I'd just like you to be a little happier in your work, but beyond that you can do what you like.\n",
      "rob: But it wasn't supposed to be like this.  When I met you we were the same people and now we're not, and...\n",
      "laura: How?  How were we the same people?\n",
      "rob: Well, you were the kind of person who came to the Artful Dodger and I was the kind of person who deejayed at the Artful Dodger.  You wore jeans and T-shirts, and so did I.  And I still do, and you don't.\n",
      "laura: Because I'm not allowed to.  I still do, after work.  So, what?  Should we just break up?  Is that what you're saying?  Because if you are, I'm going to run out of patience.\n",
      "rob: No, but...\n",
      "laura: But what?\n",
      "rob: But why doesn't it matter that we're not the same people we used to be?\n",
      "laura: You haven't changed so much as a pair of socks in the years I've known you.  If we've grown apart, then I'm the one who's done the growing, and all I've done is change jobs.\n",
      "rob: And hairstyles and clothes and attitude and friends and...\n",
      "laura: I can't go to work with my hair dyed pink.  And I can afford to go shopping more now, and I've met a couple people I like over the last year or so.\n",
      "rob: You're tougher.\n",
      "laura: More confident, maybe.\n",
      "rob: Harder.\n",
      "laura: Less neurotic.  Are you intending to stay the same for the rest of your life?\n",
      "rob: I'm alright.\n",
      "laura: Yeah, you're alright.  But you're certainly not happy.  So what happens if you get happy?  And yes I know that's the title of an Elvis Costello album, I use the reference deliberately to catch your attention. Should we split up because I'm used to you being miserable?  What happens if you, I don't know, start you're own record label, and it's a success? Time for a new girlfriend?\n",
      "rob: You're being stupid.\n",
      "laura: How?  What would be the difference between you having a record label and me going from legal aid to private practice?\n",
      "\n",
      "rob: Oh, c'mon, Laura.  Just say something. Lie, if you want.  It'd stop me asking you questions and it'd make me feel better.\n",
      "laura: Well I was gonna lie and now I can't, because you'd know I was lying.\n",
      "rob: Well why the fuck would you want to lie, anyway?\n",
      "laura: To make you feel better.\n",

      "\n",
      "rob: C'mon.  I want to know.\n",
      "laura: Want to know what, exactly?\n",
      "rob: What it was like.\n",
      "laura: It was like sex.  What else could it be like?\n",
      "rob: Was it like good sex or was it like bad sex?\n",
      "laura: What's the difference?\n",
      "rob: You know the difference.\n",
      "laura: Look, we're okay now.  We just had a nice time.  Let's leave it at that.\n",
      "rob: Okay, that's cool, okay.  But the nice time we just had... was it nicer, as nice, or less nice than the nice times you were having a couple of weeks ago?\n",
      "\n",
      "rob: So if you had a bit more energy we'd stay split.  But things being how they are, what with you wiped out, you'd like us to get back together.\n",
      "laura: Everything's too hard.  Maybe another time I would have the guts to be on my own, but not now I don't.\n",
      "rob: What about Ian?\n",
      "laura: Ray's a disaster.  I don't know what that was all about, except that sometimes you need someone to lob into the middle of a bad relationship like a hand grenade, I guess, and blow it all apart.\n",
      "rob: Mission accomplished.\n",
      "laura: I know it's not very romantic, but there will be romance again at some stage, I'm sure.  I just... I need you, Rob.  That's it.  And we know each other and we care for each other, and you've made it clear that you want me back, so...\n",
      "\n",
      "rob: You know, with Ray...\n",
      "laura: Oh, Rob, we're not going to go through that again.\n",
      "rob: No, no.  It's not... are you still on the pill?\n",
      "laura: Yes, of course.  There's nothing to worry about.\n",
      "rob: I didn't mean that.  I mean... was that all you used?\n",
      "\n",
      "rob: When are you going back?\n",
      "laura: I don't know.  Sometime.  Later. Listen, Rob, would you have sex with me?\n",
      "rob: What?\n",
      "laura: I want to feel something else than this.  It's either that or I go home and put my hand in the fire.  Unless you want to stub cigarettes out on my arm.\n",
      "rob: I've only got a couple left.  I'm saving them for later.\n",
      "laura: It'll have to be sex, then.\n",
      "\n",
      "rob: I can see why you say that.  Look, I'm sorry.  I really am.  The last thing I wanted was... that's why I left, because... I lost it, and I didn't want to blow my top in there, and... look, the reason I fucked everything up was because I was scared.  I just wanted you to know, that's all.\n",
      "laura: Thank you.  I appreciate it.  I can't reciprocate.\n",
      "rob: What do you mean?\n",
      "laura: I didn't mess things up because I was scared.  I slept with Ray because I was sick of you.  And I needed something to snap me out of it.\n",
      "rob: Sure, I understand.  Look, I don't want to take up any more of your time.  You get back, and I'll wait here for a bus.\n",
      "laura: I don't want to go back.\n",

      "rob: Sure they are.\n",
      "laura: They're not really, though, are they? I know you bought them for me, and that was really sweet of you, but that was when you were trying to turn me into you.  I can't take them, I know they'd just sit around staring at me, and I'd feel embarrassed by them and... they don't fit in with the rest of what's mine, do you understand?  That Sting record you bought for me... that was a present for me.  I like Sting and you hate him.  But the rest of this stuff...  Who the hell is Nick Lowe?  Or Gram Parsons?  Or the Boredoms?  I don't know these people.  I...\n",
      "rob: Okay, okay.  I get the picture.\n",
      "laura: I'm sorry to go on about it.  But, I don't know, there's a lesson here somewhere, and I want to make sure you get it.\n",
      "rob: I got it.  You like Sting but you don't like Gram Parsons, because you've never heard of him.\n",
      "laura: You're being deliberately obtuse.\n",
      "rob: I guess I am.\n",
      "laura: Well, think about it.\n",
      "\n",
      "rob: This is where you're supposed to say that you haven't laughed this much in ages, and then you see the error of your ways.\n",
      "laura: You make me laugh much more than Ray does, if that's what you're getting at.  But I already knew you could make me laugh.  It's everything else I don't know about.\n",
      "rob: You know I'm a good person.\n",
      "laura: Mmm hmm.\n",

      "laura: You know I didn't mind.  And it's not as if Ray's place is any better.\n",
      "rob: I'm sorry, but can we get this straight?  What is his fucking name, Ian or Ray?  What do you call him?\n",
      "laura: Ray.  I hate Ian.\n",
      "rob: I hate him too.  So I just call him \"Mavis.\" Or \"Sissyboy.\" Or \"Mavis the Sissyboy.\"\n",

      "laura: Yep.  I might have missed some stuff. I'm so used to some things being here that I don't even notice them.\n",
      "rob: Those look heavy.  Where's Ian?\n",
      "laura: He's at home.  Listen, I can't believe he went to the store.  I'm mortified, actually.  I'm really sorry.  He had no right to do that, and I told him so.\n",

It's like, if someone was in the hospital and he was seriously ill and the doctor said, I don't know if he's got a chance of survival or not, then that doesn't mean the patient's definitely going to die, now does it?  It means he might live.  Even if it's only a remote possibility.\n",

I left because we weren't exactly getting along, and we weren't talking about it.  And I suddenly realized that I like my job, and I like what my life is could be turning into, and that I'm getting to a point where I want to get my shit together and I can't really see that ever happening with you, and yeah, yeah, I sort of get interested in someone else, and that went further than it should have, so it seemed like a good time to go.

      "dante: Fuck you.\n",

      "randal: All right, if you hate this job and the people, and the fact that you have to come in on your day off, then quit.\n",
      "dante: As if it's that easy.\n",
      "randal: It is. You just up and quit. There are other jobs, and they pay better money. You're bound to be qualified for at least one of them. So what's stopping you?\n",

      "randal: You're comfortable. This is a life of convenience for you, and any attempt to change it would shatter the pathetic microcosm you've fashioned for yourself.\n",

      "dante: I can't, all right! Jesus, would you leave me alone? I can't make changes like that in my life. If I could, I would-but I don't have the ability to risk comfortable situations on the big money and the fabulous prizes.\n",

      "randal: Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.\n",
      "dante: Basically.\n",

      "dante: So?\n",
      "randal: A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.\n",
      "dante: Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.\n",
      "randal: Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.\n",

      "randal: All those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed- casualties of a war they had nothing to do with.  All right, look-you're a roofer, and some juicy government contract comes your way; you got the wife and kids and the two-story in suburbia-this is a government contract, which means all sorts of benefits. All of a sudden these left-wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three-mile radius.  You didn't ask for that. You have no personal politics. You're just trying to scrape out a living.\n",

      "dante: I guess.\n",

      "dante: Yeah.\n",
      "randal: Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.\n",
      "dante: It would stand to reason, yes.\n",
      "randal: Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.\n",
      "dante: More or less.\n",

You wanna blame somebody, blame yourself.  \"I'm not even supposed to be here today.\"  You sound like an asshole. Whose choice was it to be here today? Nobody twisted your arm. You're here today of your own violation, my friend. But you'd like to believe that the weight of the world rests on your shoulders-that the store would crumble if Dante wasn't here. Well, I got news for you, jerk: This store would survive without you. Without me either. All you do is overcompensate for having what's basically a monkey's job: You push fucking buttons. Any moron can waltz in here and do our jobs, but you're obsessed with making it seem so much more fucking important, so much more epic than it really is. You work in a convenience store, Dante. And badly, I might add. And I work in a shitty video store.  Badly, as well.  You know, that guy Jay's got it right- he has no delusions about what he does. Us?  We like to make ourselves seem so much better than the people that come in here, just looking to pick up a paper or-God forbid- cigarettes. We look down on them, as it we're so advanced.

      "dante: Yeah.\n",
      "randal: Now the first one they built was completed and fully operational before the Rebels destroyed it.\n",
      "dante: Luke blew it up. Give credit where it's due.\n",

      "dante: Compliments of Lando Calrissian.\n",
      "randal: Something just never sat right with me the second time they destroyed it. I could never put my finger on it-something just wasn't right.\n",
      "dante: And you figured it out?\n",
      "randal: Well, the thing is, the first Death Star was manned by the Imperial army- storm troopers, dignitaries-the only people onboard were Imperials.\n",
      "dante: Basically.\n",
      "randal: So when they blew it up, no prob. Evil is punished.\n",
      "dante: And the second time around...?\n",
      "randal: The second time around, it wasn't even finished yet. They were still under construction.\n",
      "dante: So?\n",
      "randal: A construction job of that magnitude would require a helluva lot more manpower than the Imperial army had to offer. I'll bet there were independent contractors working on that thing: plumbers, aluminum siders, roofers.\n",
      "dante: Not just Imperials, is what you're getting at.\n",
      "randal: Exactly. In order to get it built quickly and quietly they'd hire anybody who could do the job. Do you think the average storm trooper knows how to install a toilet main?  All they know is killing and white uniforms.\n",
      "dante: All right, so even if independent contractors are working on the Death Star, why are you uneasy with its destruction?\n",
      "randal: All those innocent contractors hired to do a job were killed- casualties of a war they had nothing to do with.  All right, look-you're a roofer, and some juicy government contract comes your way; you got the wife and kids and the two-story in suburbia-this is a government contract, which means all sorts of benefits. All of a sudden these left-wing militants blast you with lasers and wipe out everyone within a three-mile radius.  You didn't ask for that. You have no personal politics. You're just trying to scrape out a living.\n",

      "randal: All right, Vader's boss...\n",
      "dante: The Emperor.\n",
      "randal: Right, the Emperor. Now the Emperor is kind of a spiritual figure, yes?\n",
      "dante: How do you mean?\n",
      "randal: Well, he's like the pope for the dark side of the Force. He's a holy man; a shaman, kind of, albeit an evil one.\n",
      "dante: I guess.\n",
      "randal: Now, he's in charge of the Empire. The Imperial government is under his control. And the entire galaxy is under Imperial rule.\n",
      "dante: Yeah.\n",
      "randal: Then wouldn't that logically mean that it's a theocracy? If the head of the Empire is a priest of some sort, then it stands to reason that the government is therefore one based on religion.\n",
      "dante: It would stand to reason, yes.\n",
      "randal: Hence, the Empire was a fascist theocracy, and the rebel forces were therefore battling religious persecution.\n",
      "dante: More or less.\n",
      "randal: The only problem is that at no point in the series did I ever hear Leia or any of the rebels declare a particular religious belief.\n",
